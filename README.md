# CLI Snake

just a basic snake game using the terminal

## Why the terminal?

I dunno the first thing about rendering images on a macbook from scratch

## Did you make this yourself?

no, I followed a online tutorial for this mainly. As of uploading this im pretty new to game design in general so Im mainly using this as a learning experience. Most of the code belongs to the author of the tutorial, but I did some refactoring and made it work for a MACOSX device.

## How Do I Run It?

- well assuming your on a macosx device
  - Clone repo to desired location
  - Make sure yoi have **make** installed
  - run "make" in the snake directory
  - run "./bin/snake"
  - have fun :)
